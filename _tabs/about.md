This blog chronicles my journey as a Google Summer of Code 2025 contributor with [SymPy](https://sympy.org/). I'll be working on improving the performance of core polynomial computations in the library.

Expect technical deep-dives, weekly progress updates, and reflections on what itâ€™s like to contribute meaningfully to open source at scale.

Welcome aboard!
