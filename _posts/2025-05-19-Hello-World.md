Hey reader/contributor/collaborator/maintainer,

I'm Aasim, a second-year undergraduate pursuing a Bachelor of Technology in Computer Science Engineering.

I’ve been contributing to the [SymPy](https://sympy.org/) organization for some time now, and I’m excited to share that under Google Summer of Code 2025, I’ve been selected to work with SymPy on a project that aims to significantly improve the library’s performance.

Over the course of the program, there will be plenty of code written, new code paths introduced, benchmarks established, more tests added, and documentation improved. I’ll be encapsulating all of that into a series of blog posts, published weekly (or more frequently, if needed).

This first post is just a quick introduction, to me, and to the purpose of this blog.

The next post will dive into the project itself: what it is, what it aims to solve, why it matters, and the changes it will bring to SymPy.

From there on, you can expect weekly updates during the coding period. Each post will cover:

- What was planned
- What I worked on
- What I learned
- Challenges/bugs and how we solved them
- Goals for the following week
- et cetera

So… hello world,  
Welcome to my GSoC’25 blog.  
Wishing you a productive summer ahead!
